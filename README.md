# Map Levels

**Nate Edit**: I don't agree with the original scale, so I added in the `"Visited & Stayed"` option :)

**ORIGINAL `README.md` BELOW**

Mark your footprint using these simple apps

US: https://tenpages.github.io/us-level/us.html

EU: https://tenpages.github.io/us-level/eu.html

> I'm new to `js` so there might be issues with these apps.

## How to

Tap and mark countries, states or terretories you've been to. Tap "Save Image" to save and share your progress.

## Features

* Tap background to randomly change bg color
* New "Want to be here" level (0 pts but different color)
* Change languages in the legend

## Diary

There is a short post related to this project in my
[blog](https://tenpages.github.io/dev/2022/10/24/level/).

## Disclaimer

Countries potrayed in the maps are highly abstracted. Only major parts of countries are illustrated. For EU version, only sovereign countries with recognition from overwhelming majority of other countries in the world (as of 2022-10-25) are included.

## Fonts and settings

`html/slice.woff` is built from Noto Sans by Google Fonts.

`generate-font-slice.js` contains legacy files and configs from `china-ex` repository.
